# PacmanMazeSolver
This is an academic project that aims to show how to run DFS and BFS to 'solve' a maze.

Features available:
- Maze generation (you can try any size)
- Graph Class Structure (Undirected)
- Depth First Search and Breadth First Algorithm implementations
- A draft of a Tile Engine that was used to generate the Maze.

Since I'm not familiar with Unity dependencies yet, I uploadee the LeanTween (https://github.com/dentedpixel/LeanTween/) library together with my code. As soon as I get how to create a submodule with that, I'll remove and make a reference.
