# PacmanMazeSolver
This is an academic project that aims to show how to run DFS and BFS to 'solve' a maze.

Note that there is a draft of a Tile Engine that was used to generate the Maze.

Since I'm not familiar with Unity dependencies yet, I uploade the LeanTween (https://github.com/dentedpixel/LeanTween/). As soon as I get how to create a submodule with that, I'll remove and make a reference.
